    "Let's consider an autonomous vehicle driving on a highway and tracking a vehicle in front in order to initiate an overtaking maneuver. Let $x_t\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ denote the lane the vehicle in front is driving on at time $t\\in\\{1,\\dots,10\\}$. Unfortunately, the sensor readings are noisy as depicted below.\n",

    "we can integrate prior knowledge and infer the most likely situation using max-product belief propagation. A sensible prior would favor staying on the same lane over changing one lane at a time over changing two lanes at a time. This prior can be integrated via a pairwise, chain-structured Markov Random Field (also called: Hidden Markov Model or HMM) where pairwise factors between adjacent frames modulate transition likelihoods:\n",
